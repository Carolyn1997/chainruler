ChainRule is a Web3 platform for automating on-chain DeFi trading with no-code, IFTTT-based rules. Built for DeFi beginners and professional traders, ChainRule enables users to create, test, and execute trading strategies across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and more) with low Gas costs and real-time analytics. Our mission is to democratize DeFi automation, making it simple, cost-efficient, and transparent.
 Key Features:
No-Code Rule Builder: Create trading rules (e.g., "If ETH/USDT < $2000, buy $500") without coding.

Multi-Chain Support: Execute trades on Uniswap, Aave, Raydium, and more across Ethereum, Solana, and Celo.

Gas Optimization: Batch transactions and dynamic Gas pricing reduce costs by up to 90%.

Simulation Mode: Test strategies risk-free with virtual funds on real chain data.

Real-Time Analytics: Monitor prices, APY, and TVL with chain-native dashboards.

Community Governance: Share strategies via NFTs and shape the platform through voting.

Why ChainRule?
DeFi markets operate 24/7, but manual trading is time-consuming and costly. ChainRule solves this by:
Simplifying Automation: No-code rules make DeFi accessible to beginners.

Reducing Costs: Batch transactions and Gas optimization save up to 90% on fees.

Supporting Multi-Chain: Seamlessly trade across Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and more.

Empowering Communities: NFT-based strategy sharing and governance foster collaboration.

Unlike centralized trading bots (e.g., Coinrule), ChainRule is fully on-chain, non-custodial, and transparent, aligning with Web3’s ethos.
Features
No-Code IFTTT Rules: Build strategies like “If RSI < 30, buy $1000 USDT” with a drag-and-drop editor.

Multi-Chain Integration: Supports Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and Layer2s (Arbitrum, Optimism) with protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Raydium.

Gas Optimization: Batch transactions (2-5s windows) and dynamic Gas pricing via Chainlink Gas oracles.

Simulation Mode: Test rules with virtual funds synced to real chain data (e.g., Uniswap pools).

Real-Time Analytics: Dashboards for price, APY, TVL, and rule performance, powered by The Graph and Dune Analytics.

Community Governance: Share strategies as NFTs, vote on platform upgrades via governance tokens.

Developer APIs: Build custom triggers and actions with REST APIs and Solidity SDKs.

Security: Non-custodial, AES-256 encrypted API keys, audited contracts (Certik pending).

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up ChainRule locally for development or testing.
Prerequisites
Node.js: v16 or higher

Yarn: v1.22 or higher

MetaMask: Or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet

Docker: For running nodes (optional)

Hardhat: For smart contract development

API Keys:
Infura/Alchemy for Ethereum/Celo RPC

Solana RPC for Solana

Chainlink for price/Gas oracles

Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/chainrule.git
cd chainrule

Install Dependencies:
bash

yarn install

Configure Environment:
Copy .env.example to .env:
bash

cp .env.example .env

Update .env with your API keys and chain configurations:
env

INFURA_KEY=your_infura_key
SOLANA_RPC=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED=0x...
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key # For testing only

Running Locally
Start the Backend:
bash

yarn backend:start

Runs the Node.js server for rule aggregation and API services.

Start the Frontend:
bash

yarn frontend:start

Launches the React/Next.js UI at http://localhost:3000.

Deploy Smart Contracts (optional):
bash

yarn hardhat:deploy --network celo

Deploys BatchExecutor and other contracts to the specified chain.

Run Tests:
bash

yarn test

Executes unit tests for backend, frontend, and contracts.

Usage
Connect Wallet: Link MetaMask or Phantom via the UI (http://localhost:3000).

Create a Rule:
Navigate to the Rule Editor.

Example: Set “If ETH/USDT < $2000 on Uniswap, buy $500 ETH” with 2% slippage protection.

Save and activate the rule.

Test in Simulation Mode:
Enable simulation to test with virtual funds (synced to Celo mainnet data).

Monitor Performance:
View real-time analytics (e.g., rule execution, Gas costs) on the dashboard.

Share Strategies:
Export rules as NFTs to the community marketplace (coming soon).

For detailed usage, check the Documentation (WIP).
Smart Contracts
ChainRule’s core logic runs on audited smart contracts:
BatchExecutor.sol: Aggregates and executes multiple transactions in one call, reducing Gas costs.

RuleManager.sol: Stores and validates user-defined rules.

GasOptimizer.sol: Dynamically adjusts Gas prices based on Chainlink oracles.

Deployed Addresses (Mainnet, WIP):
Celo: 0x... (TBD)

Ethereum: 0x... (TBD)

Solana: Program ID... (TBD)

Audit Status: Pending Certik audit (Q2 2025).
To compile and deploy contracts:
bash

yarn hardhat:compile
yarn hardhat:deploy --network [network]

Customization Notes
Replace Placeholders: Update [your-username] with your GitHub username, and fill in actual links for the website, social media, and documentation once available.

Add Visuals: Consider adding a logo (assets/logo.png) or screenshots (assets/screenshot-rule-editor.png) to the README for visual appeal.

Contract Addresses: Update deployed contract addresses and audit status as they become available.

Documentation: Create a docs/ folder or external site (e.g., Notion, GitBook) for detailed guides, linked in the README.

CI/CD: Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for CI (e.g., linting, testing) to enable the build status badge.

If you need help setting up the repository, adding specific features (e.g., CI pipeline, contract code), or creating accompanying docs, let me know, and I can provide further assistance!
